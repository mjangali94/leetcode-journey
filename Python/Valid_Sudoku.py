# Problem: Valid Sudoku
# LeetCode URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/
# Description: Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
# Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Note:
# A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
# Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
# Medium level
